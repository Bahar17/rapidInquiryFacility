-- The Rapid Inquiry Facility (RIF) is an automated tool devised by SAHSU 
-- that rapidly addresses epidemiological and public health questions using 
-- routinely collected health and population data and generates standardised 
-- rates and relative risks for any given health outcome, for specified age 
-- and year ranges, for any given geographical area.
