#
# The Rapid Inquiry Facility (RIF) is an automated tool devised by SAHSU 
# that rapidly addresses epidemiological and public health questions using 
# routinely collected health and population data and generates standardised 
# rates and relative risks for any given health outcome, for specified age 
# and year ranges, for any given geographical area.

# Local overrides; copy Makefile.local.example to Makefile.local and edit Makefile.local

# Local Makefile overrides - example
#
# Postgres ENV variables
#
#PGHOST=localhost
#
# ENCRYPTED_POSTGRES/RIF40_PASSWORD hash comes from PGAdmin III or psql
#
# Postgres MD5 password format is: 
#
# 'md5'||md5(username||password); e.g. to set the rif40 password to: Imperial1234, use psql:
#
# SELECT md5||md5('rif40'||'Imperial1234') AS password;
#
#ENCRYPTED_POSTGRES_PASSWORD=md57d50cade66c8b224d1fbd91805cbf442
#ENCRYPTED_RIF40_PASSWORD=md5dba9980b96510989e720a66fc77d92c8
#
# Only set SAHSULAND_TABLESPACE_DIR if postgres has access to the directory!
#
# Make you escape spaces in the correct manner for the OS:
#
# e.g.
#
# Windows: SAHSULAND_TABLESPACE_DIR=\"C:rif40 database\"
#
#SAHSULAND_TABLESPACE_DIR=\"C:/rif40 database\"

#
# PL/pgsql debug levels (DEBUG_LEVEL);
#
# 0 - Suppressed, INFO only
# 1 - Major function calls
# 2 - Major function calls, data
# 3 - Reserved for future used
# 4 - Reserved for future used
#
# PSQL verbosity (VERBOSITY):
#
# verbose	- Messages/errors with full context
# terse 	- Just the error or message
#
# PSQL echo (ECHO)
#
# all: 		- All SQL
# none:		- No SQL
#
# PSQL script user (PSQL_USER)
#
# - Usually rif40 (schema owner)
#
# Use PL/R (USE_PLR)
#
# - Database has PL/R extension loaded (not needed by default)
#
# Create SAHSULAND database only (CREATE_SAHSULAND_ONLY)
#
# - Do not create SAHSULAND_DEV
