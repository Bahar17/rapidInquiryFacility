#that rapidly addresses epidemiological and public health questions using 
#routinely collected health and population data and generates standardised 
#rates and relative risks for any given health outcome, for specified age 
#and year ranges, for any given geographical area.

# NOTE: Make sure that if you're going to run the data loader tool with SQL Server or PostgreSQL,
# you set these properties properly.  'databaseType' provides a signal to the data loader tool to
# make use of either the database connection details for sql server (specify "ms") or postgresql
# (specify "pg")
#

#Uncomment the line below if you want to use SQL Server
#databaseType=ms 
databaseType=pg


#This is a small file that contains the user ID and password that the Data Loader Tool will
#use to create and process new tables.  It is a simple text file that is not bundled with
#the RIF for security reasons.  But it will simply be a *.txt file with lines like the following
#
#userID=postgres
#password=[[[whatever the password is for the postgres user]]]
