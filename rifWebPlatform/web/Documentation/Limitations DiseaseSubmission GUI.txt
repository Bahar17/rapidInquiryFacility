- Limitations RIF 4.0 Javascript GUI

	1. Within the investigation modal dialog, parameters will not update should numerator/denominator selection change or study area resolution/selectAt change.
	   --- Solve as follows:
		       Add update parameter's button in investigation modal dialog, preferably next to the add investigation button.  
			   This  event should propagate from menu unit "investigationParameters" to mediator and then back to menu unit "investigationParameters".
	   --- Parameters affected:
		       Max/Min years available ( dependent on num/denom selection)
               Age groups available    ( dependent on num/denom selection)	   
			   Covariates available    ( dependent on study area resolution/selectAt selection)
			   
	2. Study Geography parameter hardcode to 'SAHSU'
	   --- Solve as follows:
		       Create an extra drop down in the front menus following the custom drop down style adopted consistently across the diseasSubmission dahsboard. 
			   Implement javascript code within the 'frontSubmission' unit, handle selection and variable event change to set the RIF.geography global variable.
			   
	3. Replace health theme description parameter in getNumeratorDenominator request method with health theme name 
	   --- Solve as follows:
		       Wait for middleware and database to be ready for the change in parameter.
			   Store health theme name somewhere eithr in the HTML or javascript, each dropdown entry follows the same html format:
			   <div><a href="#"> some text </a></div>
			   An idea could be to have the name in the href attribute as "#aGivenName" then retrieve that upon click and pass it on to Mediator. Right now mediator receives the text between the <a> tag, which is the Health theme description.
			   
	4. Map clicks stop being captured in Chrome occasionally when inspector/debugger is open, 
	   --- Solve as follows:
		       Close and reopen Chrome.
