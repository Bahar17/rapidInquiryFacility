# Peter Hambly Progress Report RIF 4.0

Principal Work Areas: **Postgres Database, node, system integration**

## 2015
### May
#### 10th-15 May

Alter script #7

Support for taxonomies/ontologies (e.g. ICD9, 10); removed previous table based support.
Modify t_rif40_inv_conditions to remove SQL injection risk

Done:

* rif40_outcomes - list of ontologies to remain - remove all field except for:
	outcome_type, outcome_description, current_version, current_sub_version, previous_version
* Add new outcome_group to rif40_outcome_groups for SAHUSLAND_CANCER
* Fix rif40_tables, rif40_table_outcomes, rif40_outcome_groups join for SAHUSLAND_CANCER
  - Add view: rif40_numerator_outcome_columns
  - Add checks: to rif40_inv_conditions, rif40_num_denom, rif40_num_denom_errors
* Drop existing ontology tables (keep icd9/10 until new ontology middleware is ready)
* Modify t_rif40_inv_conditions to remove SQL injection risk:
  - Rename column condition to min_condition
  - Add columns: max_condition, predefined_group_name, outcome_group_name
  - Add foreign key constraint on rif40_predefined_groups(predefined_group_name)
  - Add foreign key constraint on rif40_outcome_groups(outcome_group_name)
  - Add check constraints: 
    1. min_condition or predefined_group_name
    2. max_condition may be null, but if set != min_condition
* Rebuild rif40_inv_conditions:
  - Add back condition, derive from: min_condition, max_condition, predefined_group_name, outcome_group_name
  - Add numer_tab, field_name, column_exists and column_comments fields for enhanced information
* Load new rif40_create_disease_mapping_example()
 
#### 18th-22nd May

* rif40_GetMapAreas() fix - the following query works at LEVEL4 but returns NULL at other levels

```sql
SELECT SUBSTRING(rif40_xml_pkg.rif40_GetMapAreas(
			'SAHSU' 	/* Geography */, 
			'LEVEL3' 	/* geolevel view */, 
			55.5268097::REAL /* y_max */, -4.88653803 /* x_max */, 52.6875343 /* y_min */, -7.58829451 /* x_min - Bounding box - from cte */)::Text
				FROM 1 FOR 160) AS json 
LIMIT 4;
```

* topojson_convert.js - add name, gid and area_id as properties; validated link

#### 26th-29th May

Alter script #7 continued.

Clean up rif40_columns, rif40_tables_and_views, rif40_triggers. This is so the DDL tests now pass

Done:

* DDL test suite fixes:

	1. Tidy up RIF40_TABLES_AND_VIEWS table_or_view column, drop column TABLE_OR_VIEW_NAME_HREF, add primary key and check constraint
	2. Tidy up RIF40_COLUMNS, drop columns: TABLE_OR_VIEW_NAME_HREF, COLUMN_NAME_HREF; add primary and foreign key and check constraint 
	3. Remove existing ontology tables (keep icd9/10 until new ontology middleware is ready)
	4. Remove columns dropped from RIF40_OUTCOMES and T_RIF40_INV_CONDITIONS
	5. Add new view: RIF40_NUMERATOR_OUTCOME_COLUMNS 
	6. Add new columns for: RIF40_INV_CONDITIONS and T_RIF40_INV_CONDITIONS
    7. RIF40_OUTCOMES trigger removed from rif40_triggers
    8. Add primary and foreign keys to rif40_triggers
	
* Regression tested OK. Still expecting some problems on wpea-rif1. Still no support for old studies
* Improved make targets - made database aware
* RIF startup procedure: added application name support, no check mode (for middleware testing) 

#### 1st-5th June

* Full regression test of database build
* Port to MacOS, regression test
* Install Tomcat 8 on Windows, MacOS, Tomcat 6 on Redhat Enterprise Linux 5. Checked Tomcat 6 will work.
* Started work on unified build using make in rifBuild tree
* Tested Middleware WAR build from github, dependency issues found 

#### 8th-12th June

* Middleware WAR build now OK (mainly thanks to Kev)
* Integrated with make using Powershell on Windows
* Install.ps1 created that gains the elevated privileges required. Install RIF middleware and test WAR unpack.

#### 15th-19th June

* Simple test harness for SELECT and INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE. Select uses arrays to check return data; exceptions are verified.
* Improve exception handlers and error messages:

Error context and message >>>
Message:  rif40_sql_pkg.rif40_sql_test(): Test case: TRIGGER TEST #2: rif40_studies.suppression_value IS NULL FAILED, invalid statement type: %%SQL> INSERT;
Hint:
Detail:   -71065
Context:  SQL statement "SELECT rif40_log_pkg.rif40_error(-71065, 'rif40_sql_test',
                        'Test case: % FAILED, invalid statement type: %%SQL> %;',
                        test_case_title::VARCHAR, UPPER(SUBSTRING(LTRIM(test_stmt) FROM 1 FOR 6))::VARCHAR, E'\n'::VARCHAR, test_stmt::VARCHAR)"
PL/pgSQL function rif40_sql_test(character varying,character varying,anyarray,character varying,boolean) line 396 at PERFORM

i.e. internal error code retuned in detail

#### 22th-26th June

Immediate TODO list: 

* Add control table (rif40_test_harness) for test harness, _rif40_test_sql_template() function to simplify creation, add common datatype shareable with SQL server:
  XML; SQL server does not understand arrays)
* Trigger test harness: RIF40_COVARIATES, RIF40_ERROR_MESSAGES, RIF40_GEOGRAPHIES, RIF40_PREDEFINED_GROUPS, RIF40_STUDY_SHARES, RIF40_TABLE_OUTCOMES,
  RIF40_TABLES, RIF40_VERSION, T_RIF40_COMPARISON_AREAS, T_RIF40_CONTEXTUAL_STATS, T_RIF40_GEOLEVELS, T_RIF40_INV_CONDITIONS, T_RIF40_INV_COVARIATES,
  T_RIF40_INVESTIGATIONS, T_RIF40_NUM_DENOM, T_RIF40_RESULTS, T_RIF40_STUDIES, T_RIF40_STUDY_AREAS, T_RIF40_USER_PROJECTS 
* Modify alter 7 so that existing conditions become rif40_error(...); /* Existing condition */ e.g.

SELECT 1 AS x
 WHERE 1 = rif40_log_pkg.rif40_error(-90125, 'rif40_error', 'Dummy error: %', 'Test'::VARCHAR);

or

SELECT rif40_log_pkg.rif40_error(-90125, 'rif40_error', 'Dummy error: %', 'Test'::VARCHAR) AS x;

Raises an exception!

#### 29th June-3rd July

No work on the RIF40_COLUMNS

#### 5th July-10th July

* RIF covariates example data 
* Specification for individual level SAHSULAND_CANCER example data

#### 13th - 14th July

* Test harness tables (alter_8.sql)

#### 15th July - 31st July

* Caving in Slovenia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Migovec_System 
  and: https://www.union.ic.ac.uk/rcc/caving/slovenia/intro/slov_intro.php 

#### 3rd - 7th August 

Created test harness test data (to test the functionality); the basic principle is that each test 
(or series of linked tests) is a single transaction. This is not possible in Plpgsql; so needs
one of:

a) dblink (tested, works, no support for debugging or output capture;
b) Foreign data wrappers, no support for output capture;
c) Java, considered, choose;
d) Node.js to avoid confusion with middleware

#### 10th to 14th August
  
Convert test data from Postgres array to XML format. 

To do:

* Support for Postgres debugging
* Replace dblink test harness runner with Node.js version so that debugging and output can be controlled.
* EXPLAIN plan support
* Linked tests (based on the study 1 test scenario)
* Test regime; for all rif40 schema tables

  * Constraints:

    a) NOT null
    b) Check i) correct; ii) incorrect
    c) Primary key i) correct; ii) duplicate iii) missing parent

  * Access control:
  
    d) notarifuser access

  * Business logic:

    e) Triggers
  
From August: 

1. Test harness
2. RIF batch integration
3. Complete webserver integration
	* Fix pernicious mixed content issues in JS frontend
	* Test wpea-darwin remotely; using JS on httpd (i.e. minimise reverse proxy traffic)  
	* Secure wpea-darwin httpd by jailing it; re-penetration test; add caching. Shields to be lowered when 
	  secure logons are integrated into the middleware and the JS frontend
4. Complete R integration
5. Integrate and test Java run study
6. Complete build instructions
7. Build and integrate node middleware server:
	* GeoJSON to TopoJSON conversion; converted node program to using HTTP POST methods
	* Secure logons using session_ids, time stamps and eliptic curve cryptography (public/private keys)
	* Shapefile conversion to WKT (Well known test) format later
