### Microsoft SQL server - Margaret

* (Finally) starting to work on porting Peter's super-complicated test harness code from pgsql to T-SQL.
* Returning to the automated testing issue.  I compared what Peter has set up for Postgres with the existing SQL Server automated testing tools.  
  I don't see any SQL Server tools that would not require explicitly hard-coding every test case, and we don't want that.

Focus is still on testing (when there is time to work on the RIF).
