Work in this period focussed on Tomcat integration, with a clean build direct from github achieved. Tomcat 6-8 confirmed 
as working with the new RIF. A SQL test harness for SELECT (data fetch) and INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE (data manipulation triggers) statements. 
SELECT tests checks returned data; trigger exceptions are verified. Exception handlers and error messages were improved.

Focus in the next period will be on the test harness to allow the SQL server port to be verified. This will be followed 
by RIF batch integration and the creation of test data for RIF data loader.
