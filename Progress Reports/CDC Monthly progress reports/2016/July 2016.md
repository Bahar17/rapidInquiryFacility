## Data Loader - Kevin

No work

## Front end (webPlatform)

### Disease Mapping - David

- Integrated taxonomy service into parameters modal

### Data viewer - David

- Now using local version of RIF database
- adding calls to the middleware
- Study submission JSON object almost complete
- Choropleth mapping for a test dataset in dataviewer

## Middleware

### Web services (rifServices) - Kevin/David

My most significant progress for the month has been to take an inventory of existing web service calls that support our applications and to analyse all of the 
database queries that they use.  The analysis has allowed me to more accurately estimate the amount of work that will be required to support SQL Server porting 
activities.  Of the 54 middleware methods that are responsible for supporting end-user application features, it can be proven that 10 of them will not require a
ny porting work because they do not use SQL queries.  A further 17 are unlikely to require porting because the SQL queries they use are already likely to be 
completely compliant with the most basic parts of the SQL standard.  

2 may require some porting because they have query fragments that may not be equally supported between PostgreSQL and SQL Server.  
23 existing methods would require that code from a database query be moved into Java-based middleware classes. However, some of these methods may prove unnecessary 
to support a production environment and others may be able to be deleted in favour of having them easily rewritten in the front end.  1 method needs to be 
implemented and 1 requires that the database be modified to support a new concept: calculation methods.  

We are currently investigating three ways of simplifying the work needed to be done in the middleware: reviewing methods to ensure they are justified by production 
use and not just from prototyping efforts; moving some methods into the front end; and reviewing whether we can retrieve large blocks of data from result tables 
to reduce the number of methods needed to support rendering smoothed data.

### Run study batch - Kevin

#### Running R - Kevin 

As part of the invoking R code from a Java program, I have worked to produce code that can be viewed as "sandwiching" the Bayesian smoothing algorithms for HET, 
BYM and CAR.  Currently, the inclusion of the R smoothing algorithms is focusing on interoperability rather than integration; Java builds up a command-line call 
to an R engine and invokes it.  The R script then runs as if it were invoked on its own and it receives command-line arguments supplied by the Java program.  

My work has been limited to: (1) minimising potential problems in creating and invoking the command-line call to the smoothing script and (2) ensuring that when 
the algorithm finishes, the results are copied to the appropriate tables (they are of the form rif_studies.s[studyID]_map. 

#### R - Brandon

- Assisted KG in R integration work

### Ontology support - Kevin

Finished work on the taxonomy services.  The taxonomy services that are used by the web-based applications to retrieve taxonomy terms (eg: ICD-10 codes) now work
properly and have been separated into a web application that can be run independently form the rest of the RIF.
