# Network location of the taxonomy services server.
# Use when:
#
# * The taxonomy services is not running on the same server as rifServices
# * HTTPS is used
# 
# You do NOT need to do anything if you are running without TLS (i.e. on a laptop)
#
# If set to: https://localhost:8080 as suggested then host validation is disabled; otherwise 
# you must set up JAVA TLS host verification; typical errors include:
#
# java.security.cert.CertificateException: No name matching a.b.com found
# [This means you need create a correctly signed certificate and add to the keystore]
# 
# javax.net.ssl.SSLHandshakeException: sun.security.validator.ValidatorException: PKIX path building 
# failed: sun.security.provider.certpath.SunCertPathBuilderException: unable to find valid certification 
# path to requested target
# [This means there is a certificate but it is not correctly signed]
#
# You can also typically get meessages that Java cannot find the keystore and/or TLS is not setup 
# correctly]

# RIF services uses Taxonomy services directly a) when creating study JSON from the database using 
# "Save completed study" and b) when creating the same file for the export ZIP file.
