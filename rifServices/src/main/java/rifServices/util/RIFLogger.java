/**
 * This is a class used for error logging and provides a facade to the underlying
 * SL4J logging facilities.  The class has been developed as part of a temporary
 * work-around for transitivity problems we've encountered with classes in the 
 * SL4J jars.  By using this class, we've reduced the number of times that SL4J
 * is explicitly called in the code base.  For now we're commenting out references
 * to SL4J until the transitive dependencies problems can be addressed.

 * The Rapid Inquiry Facility (RIF) is an automated tool devised by SAHSU 
 * that rapidly addresses epidemiological and public health questions using 
 * routinely collected health and population data and generates standardised 
 * rates and relative risks for any given health outcome, for specified age 
 * and year ranges, for any given geographical area.

/*
 * Code Road Map:
 * --------------
 * Code is organised into the following sections.  Wherever possible, 
 * methods are classified based on an order of precedence described in 
 * parentheses (..).  For example, if you're trying to find a method 
 * 'getName(...)' that is both an interface method and an accessor 
 * method, the order tells you it should appear under interface.
 * 
 * Order of 
 * Precedence     Section
 * ==========     ======
 * (1)            Section Constants
 * (2)            Section Properties
 * (3)            Section Construction
 * (7)            Section Accessors and Mutators
 * (6)            Section Errors and Validation
