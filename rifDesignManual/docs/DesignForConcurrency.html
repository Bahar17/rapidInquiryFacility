<h1>Design for Concurrency</h1>

<p>
Designing for concurrency helps ensure that when multiple threads of execution try to access
the same resource at the same time, that any contentions are resolved so that the behaviour of the code
remains predictable.  Without this guarantee, a test case that passes in one run may fail in 
another run.  As well, unexpected errors may happen in scenarios that cannot be easily replicated.

<p>
In single-threaded programs, it is easy to trace a flow of execution.  We can rely on a predictable sequence
of steps that helps make a piece of code behave predictably. In multi-threaded programs, Thread A may execute 
a few steps before being stopped to allow another Thread B to execute another sequence of steps.  The order
in which the threads execute their code may become unpredictable.  If Thread A and Thread B are both trying
to access the same object X, the sequence of steps that are executed could leave X in an undetermined state.
</p>

<p>
In single-threaded programs, we can often rely on a body of test cases to help us identify
problems in code we've written.  If you change a piece of code and test cases suddenly begin to fail, then you
can make the assumption that each time you run the same group of test cases the same failures will occur.  
The consistent outcome of running the test case suites can help narrow the sources of problems until they can be
identified and fixed.

<p>
In testing multi-threaded programs, the scenarios that lead to a contention amongst multiple threads may not occur
every time the same test suites are run.  Some scenarios may ever happen unless the software is tested
with specific data sets and there are hundreds or thousands of execution threads running at the same time.

<p>
Fixing multi-threading errors can be very difficult because detecting them in the first place can be very difficult.  
Furthermore, in a project having few developer resources, the time needed to identify and fix concurrency bugs could be 
longer than it would take in projects that had more people.  The difficulty in fixing multi-threading errors 
provides great motivation to invest in a strategy that prevents them from happening in the first place.  


We break our approach down into two parts.  First, we take a high-level view to examine how the different tools
might be used together to encourage concurrent access problems to occur.  The goal of the analysis is to identify 
ways that the tools are used and created could help reduce the likelihood of certain patterns of use from happening.  
Then we look at the code base and develop ways to minimise the likelihood that executing the code will cause 
concurrency problems.



<h2>
Identifying scenarios of resource contention amongst tools in the RIF tool suite
</h2>
For this analysis, we identify three types of concurrent access scenarios which might result in concurrency problems.  
These are:
<ul>
<li>
simultaneous reads
</li>
<li>
simultaneous writes
</li>
<li>
simultaneous read and write (stale reads)
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Two tools which are reading data at the same time shouldn't produce concurrency problems providing that the data are not being 
updated while they do it.  Therefore, we exclude this scenario from further consideration.  Simultaneous writes by 
different tools may leave a database record in an undetermined state.  If one tool is updating a database that is being read 
by another tool, there may be a possibility of having a stale read problem.  
</p>

<p>
For each of simultaneous writes and simultaneous read and write, we examine different pairings of tools.

<p>
A green "N" means there is no potential for a stale read situation because
the tools don't interact with each other in that way.  Areas showing a red "Y" show that there is potential
for one tool to read data that are being produced by another.  For example, the Study Submission Tool does not 
read data written by the Study Result Viewer and therefore that relationship is labeled "N". The Study
Submission Tool could be reading data that are being updated by the Data Loader Tool; therefore, that area
of the table is assigned a "Y".

<p>
We can help eliminate some problem areas by prescribing how the tool suite should be used.  For 
example, it is a common practice to suggest shutting down end-user tools when the database on which
they depend is being significantly updated.  We anticipate that data loading activities will happen
infrequently throughout a year.  But when they are happening, they may last for a few days.
</p>

<p>
For some software projects, it is extremely important to develop high-availability systems where there
is little down-time for the system.  Developers may create sophisticated ways of allowing users to
continue using data when the data sets are being altered.  However, in our project, we do not expect that 
our users would be significantly inconvenienced if they could not access the system for a few periods of a few days.  
</p>


<blockquote>
<font color="green">
<i>
<b>
<a href="SummaryOfDesignDecisions.html#concurrency2">
Concurrency-2
</a>
</b>: 
When the Data Loader Tool is loading data sets, the other tools should not be in use. When
end user tools are being used, the Data Loader Tool should not be in use.
</i>
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
By prescribing restrictions for how the tools should be used in practice, we are reducing the likelihood that
certain kinds of stale read and concurrent write problems will occur.

<p>
Another way to reduce concurrency problem areas is to ensure that a new study has been completely created 
before it can appear visible to parts of either the Study Submission Tool or the Study Result Viewer Tool.  
The Study Submission Tool will allow users to create new studies by copy existing ones. If a study has been 
partially created, there may be inconsistencies between the properties of a copied study and the properties of the 
original, which may be in the process of changing.  As well, it may be a problem if the Study Result Viewer can try
to obtain results for studies which may have only been partially created.
</p>


<blockquote>
<font color="green">
<i>
<b>
<a href="SummaryOfDesignDecisions.html#concurrency3">
Concurrency-3
</a>
</b>: 
The Study Submission Tool should submit a new study as part of a single atomic database transaction.  Once a study
has been created it becomes immutable.  However, it can be copied to make a new study.  Until a study description has 
been completely created in the database, neither the Study Submission Tool nor the Study Viewer Tools should be able
to access it.
</i>
</font>
</blockquote>





<p>
We can try to limit the number of instances of any one tool which are operating.  For example, although we anticipate
that many people may be using the Study Submission Tool and Study Result Viewer Tool, it seems clear that there would
only need to be one instance of the Data Loader Tool and the IT Governance Tool running at once.
</p>


<blockquote>
<font color="green">
<i>
<b>
<a href="SummaryOfDesignDecisions.html#concurrency4">
Concurrency-4
</a>
</b>: 
The tool suite should allow only one instance of the Data Loader Tool and one instance of the IT Governance
Tool to run at the same time.
</i>
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
By applying these decisions, our matrices of tool interactions can now show fewer potential problem areas:

<p>
We can also limit some concurrency concerns if we recognise that some tools will be web applications and others will
be desktop applications.  Both the Study Submission Tool and the Study Result Viewer will be produced as web applications.
The web services we develop cannot make assumptions about the order in which service methods are called.  The web application
calls to web services are made asynchronously, and the URLs that are submitted to web services could be easily submitted
in a different order by a malicious code script.
</p>

<p>
In contrast, the Data Loader Tool and the IT Governance Tool will be Swing-based desktop applications.  Whereas the web server
cannot make assumptions about what is submitting URL requests, we can guarantee that end users of the RIF Manager tools will
be forced to use the Swing-based electronic forms.  We can rely on the Swing-based applications to use guided 
data entry features and modal dialogs to limit the order in which service methods are called.  Furthermore, these tools can
support many of their features without having to make asynchronous calls.  
</p>



<blockquote>

Study Result Viewer tools, assume they can may call any service method in any order.
</i>

</blockquote>


<h2>
Minimising Concurrency Problems in the Code Base
</h2>

<p>
In this section, we forget about concurrent access activities at the tool level and focus on concurrent access activities
at the level of the code base.  Our goal here is to produce service methods which are thread-safe: they can exhibit
predictable behaviour in a multi-threaded environment, regardless of the order in which threads are run.

<p>
First we should recall one of the aspects of our coding philosophy that governs the whole body of middleware.  
Preventing concurrency problems from happening depends heavily on adopting best practice coding conventions which will 
be described later in this section. The coding techniques must be adopted uniformly across the code base so that we can 
eliminate certain scenarios from consideration as we identify the sources of potential concurrency problems. 
</p>

<p>
For seasoned developers, applying a coding technique may be required in one situation but may not be necessary to use in
another similar situation.  Experience can help inform when to use a technique or not.  However, in the interest in 
maintaining a thread-safe code base by developers with little skill, it is best that by default, a coding technique is 
applied in all similar cases for a given kind of scenario.  Using a number of conventions, a novice developer can help 
make a method thread-safe without knowing why it works. Although this benefit carries some risk, for small-budget projects
the team may have little choice.
</p>

<blockquote>
<font color="green">
<i>
<b>
<a href="SummaryOfDesignDecisions.html#gen_design8">
General Design-8
</a>
</b>: 
Apply the steps of the coding philosophy:
<ol>
<li>get it working</li>
<li>get it working for the next developer</li>
<li>get it working well</li>
</ol>
<p>
As well, favour coding to convention over coding to circumstance.
</i>
</font>
</blockquote>


<p>
The next step in our approach is to review another one of our general decisions, which is to minimise the number of 
execution paths in the code and to force front-end applications to interact with the database via the service methods provided
by the middleware.  Taking these steps does not fix concurrency problems but helps limit what pathways through the code are
likely to have potential contentions amongst many threads. 
</p>

<blockquote>
<font color="green">
<i>
<b>
<a href="SummaryOfDesignDecisions.html#gen_design4">
General Design-4
</a>
</b>: 
Wherever possible, limit the paths of execution that are likely to occur.
</i>
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
Here we can summarise three techniques which are discusses in other
areas of the design manual:
<ul>
<li>
make the visibility of variables, methods and classes as restrictive as possible
</li>
<li>
support proper encapsulation where code can access an object's data only via publicly visible accessor methods
</li>
<li>
encapsulate the business concept layer and the data storage layer using service interfaces
</li>
</ul>

</p>


<p>
As another measure to help minimise the code execution scenarios which could go wrong, we should also decide on how we
support or restrict sub-classing.  We have limited our commitment to software reuse by indicating that the services may
be reused by other client applications.  It must first be proven that the RIF code base works to support its current goals
before we can give priority for making it reusable in use cases that were not initially envisioned for our project.
We don't predict there will be any urgent need for other developers to want to sub-class any of the Java classes in the
middleware.  It is likely that only the people on the RIF team will need to subclass the class files and they will
do this only after they can justify extending them.  Therefore, we again present here one of the general design decisions
for limiting subclasses.
</p>

<blockquote>
<font color="green">
<i>
<b>
<a href="SummaryOfDesignDecisions.html#gen_design9">
General Design-9
</a>
</b>: 
If a class is not abstract, it should be marked "final" to disuade developers from sub-classing it.
</i>
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
Once we have minimised the number of likely execution paths through the code base, we can focus on building a collection of test 
suites that exercise the service methods and business classes that are used by client applications.  One important
way of designing for concurrency is to ensure that the test cases can pass in a single-threaded environment first.
Maintaining testability in a single-threaded context allows us to eliminate other causes of error before we conclude that a 
failed test case is caused by contention amongst threads.  If versions of the test cases pass in a single-threaded environment
but fail when used in a multi-threaded environment, then we may be more confident that a concurrency problem may account
for the difference.
</p>

<blockquote>
<font color="green">
<i>
<b>
<a href="SummaryOfDesignDecisions.html#concurrency6">
Concurrency-6
</a>
</b>: 
Maintain test suites that will pass in a single-threaded environment.  Then adapt copies of those test suites
for a multi-threaded environment.  Use the differences in pass results to identify potential concurrency problems.
</i>
</font>
</blockquote>



<p>
We need to decide to what extent we should trust the database to manage concurrent access scenarios.
Microsoft SQL Server, PostgreSQL and Oracle will each have long established mechanisms to handle scenarios 
where database queries are submitted simultaneously.  However, it is unclear whether they would handle these 
scenarios in the same way.  
</p>

<p>
If the RIF supported only one type of database, then we could choose a database driver that was considered 
thread-safe.  We could then rely on the database to handle problems with two threads trying to concurrently 
access the same database connection object.  However, we need to support multiple database vendors and cannot 
assume that the database driver will be considered thread-safe.  Therefore, we must assume that the middleware 
is responsible for ensuring that there are no concurrent access problems for its shared resources.
</p>

<blockquote>
<font color="green">
<i>
<b>
<a href="SummaryOfDesignDecisions.html#concurrency7">
Concurrency-7
</a>
</b>: 
Assume that various database vendors may not support concurrent access to records in exactly the same way.
Further assume that none of the JDBC database connections are thread-safe, even though for some databases they
definitely are.  Assume that the middleware must take its own measures to mediate concurrent access for queries it 
applies to the database.
</i>
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
It is also important that we make some assumptions about how the client applications and the RIF database will handle concurrency
issues.  Although we would hope that front-end client applications would not cause concurrency problems, it is best if
we assume they will.  We should assume that a client application may call any of the service methods in any order.  We should
also assume that a client application may have multiple threads which could attempt to alter parameter values it passes to
service methods.
</p>


<blockquote>
<font color="green">
<i>
<b>
<a href="SummaryOfDesignDecisions.html#concurrency8">
Concurrency-8
</a>
</b>: 
Assume that the front-end client applications will have multiple threads that may each be trying to alter parameter
values the applications pass to the middleware service methods.
</i>
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
One way to eliminate the side effects of concurrency errors induced by the client applications is to 
"safe-copy" the values it passes to service methods.  In safe copying, a deep copy of each formal parameter is
done as the first step in the method.  All subsequent actions applied to the parameter values will affect the
local copies of the objects, rather than the original objects.  If the client application has threads which
change the values of the values it passes to the middleware, the middleware will not be affected because it is
using its own copies.
</p>



<blockquote>
<font color="green">
<i>
<b>
<a href="SummaryOfDesignDecisions.html#concurrency9">
Concurrency-9
</a>
</b>: 
Perform a deep-copy of any mutable object that is passed to a service method by a client application.  This 
action will prevent the client from altering parameter values while they are being processed by the middleware.
</i>
</font>
</blockquote>


<p>
If the middleware assumes that any of its methods could be called in any order by asynchronous threads, then
it should try to minimise how much it needs to 'remember' from one call to the next.  Each thing it remembers forms
part of its state, and if multiple threads can access it, then they could contend for them simultaneously.
Minimising the state of the middleware invites us to explore ways of reducing the scope of variables so they cannot
be accessed simultaneously by multiple threads.  
</p>

<p>
Suppose a variable X is declared as a class variable which is accessible by public methods.  Multiple threads which call
those methods may experience contention in trying to change or read the state of X.  However, if X is declared as a local
variable within a method, then each thread that calls that method will maintain separate copies of the variable.  If it is
possible to move a variable declaration from within a class to within a method, it is desirable to do so.  The move helps
guarantee that the variable will only be accessed by a single calling thread.
</p>



<blockquote>
<font color="green">
<i>
<b>
<a href="SummaryOfDesignDecisions.html#concurrency10">
Concurrency-10
</a>
</b>: 
Where it is possible, favour using method variables over using class variables.  Class variables can be
accessed by multiple threads, but local variables in methods will be used by only a single calling thread.
</i>
</font>
</blockquote>


<p>
It is also desirable to limit the lifetime of variables.  Class variables have a lifetime that is the lifetime of the object,
whereas method variables exist only for the duration needed to execute the method.  Limiting the lifetime of a variable 
reduces the opportunities that multiple threads could have to use it at the same time.
</p>


<blockquote>
<font color="green">
<i>
<b>
<a href="SummaryOfDesignDecisions.html#concurrency11">
Concurrency-11
</a>
</b>: 
Declare variables as close as possible to when they will be first used.
</i>
</font>
</blockquote>


<p>
Another way to reduce potential concurrency problems is to declare class variables as final wherever possible.
The final variables will be assigned either as part of the declaration statement or as part of a static code
block that will be loaded when the class is loaded by the JVM.  Marking class variables as final effectively
turns them into constants.  If some part of the class code tries to reassign the value of the final variable,
the compiler will complain.  If during execution multiple threads attempt to set the value of the same final
variable, an exception will be thrown.


<blockquote>
<font color="green">
<i>
<b>
<a href="SummaryOfDesignDecisions.html#concurrency12">
Concurrency-12
</a>
</b>: 
Wherever possible, declare class variables as <code>final</code>.
</i>
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
One common source of concurrency problems occurs when an object is used before it has finished being instantiated.
In multi-threaded execution environments, it is considered best practice to ensure objects are "safely constructed".
One common way of implementing safe construction is to create new instances through a static factory method rather
than through the use of the class's constructors.  To facilitate safe construction, all the business classes have
private access for constructors and a static method called <code>newInstance()</code>.
</p>

<p>
The following example from the code base shows how this is done:
</p>

<code>
<pre>
public class HealthCode 
	extends RIFAbstractConcept {

...

	private HealthCode() {
		isTopLevelTerm = false;
		code = "";
		nameSpace = "";
		description = "";

<p>
We use a similar approach for doing deep copying of an object.  Each class has a
static method called <code>createCopy(...)</code> which also attempts to support safe contruction.
These methods prevent the reference to the created object from being visible to other threads
until it has finished being created and initialised.

Support "safe construction" of business objects.  In business classes, make constructors private and 
rely on static factory methods <code>newInstance(...)</code> and 
<code>createCopy(...)</code> to control the creation of new objects.

<p>
We can use the same safe construction technique to help control the creation of manager class objects that
may be used by multiple services
