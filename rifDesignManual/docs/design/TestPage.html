<h1>General Architecture</h1>

<h2>
The RIF as a tool suite rather than just a tool
</h2>
<p>
The first goal of RIF design is to divide a large, complex feature set in a way that best benefits 
the needs of different end users and which promotes division of labour on the development team.  
Whereas RIF v3.0 supported different types of users with a single application, RIF v4.0 will rely on a 
collection of related tools which target different user roles and tasks.  Developing specialised tools 
allows the user interface and learning materials of each tool to be streamlined for a specific audience.  
By separating the concerns of each type of user and by establishing how the tools would interact with 
one another, the design will provide project modules that promote a clean division of labour amongst 
the developers.
</p>

<p>
The most reasonable dividing line of features exists between those needed by the scientists and those 
needed by the RIF managers.  Epidemiologists, GIS scientists and statisticians may be interested in 
creating and running studies and visualising the results.  RIF managers need to be able to load geospatial 
and health data into the database.  They also need the ability to inspect either the study question or 
the study answer to determine whether the results are too sensitive to release or not.  Figure XXX 
shows a tool suite that supports these tasks:
</p>

  
<p>
<i><b>Fig. XXX</b>: Old vs new designs of the Rapid Inquiry Facility.  In the new version, the feature 
set is supported by four rather than one tool.</i>
</p>

<p>
Creating a study and viewing its results are related but different activities.  Creating a study focuses 
on data entry, whereas retrieving results focuses on maps, graphs and ways of visualising combinations of 
health and geographic information.  The administrative tasks of loading new data into the RIF database and 
evaluating the data protection implications of studies are another example of very different tasks being 
supported for the same role.
</p>

<h2>
Use a 3 Tiered Architecture
</h2>

<p>
Another way to divide the software project is by the computational theme of each task.  For any user 
feature, there is usually a common sequence of operations
<ol>
<li>
gather data from the users via electronic forms
</li>
<li>
perform some kind of business operation that makes use of the knowledge about business concepts
</li>
<li>
store or retrieve data from the database
</li>
<li>
render results of the operation
</li>
</ol>

<p>
These tasks roughly coincide with areas of expertise on the team.  Federico Fabbri has done extensive 
work designing web-based geospatial applications; Peter Hambly has spent years developing the RIF 
database; and I've spent years writing reusable software services.  The computational themes and the 
skill sets invite us to use a common three-tiered architecture for design.



<blockquote>
<font color="green">
<i>
<b>
<a href="SummaryOfDesignDecisions.html#gen_design2">
General Design-2
</a>
</b>: 
Organise code using a common three tier architecture that has the 	following layers: a presentation layer 
for managing GUI code; a business concept layer for 	managing the way business concepts are expressed 
in the system; and a data storage layer 	for managing the task of reading data from or writing data 
to the database.
</i>
</font>
</blockquote>




<p>
In this design, the <b>presentation layer</b> contains all the code that is used to create electronic 
forms, graphs and reports.  It is concerned with supporting guided data entry features and restricting 
user actions to those which are necessary for supporting features.  The <b>business concept layer</b> 
contains classes which describe the concepts that should be meaningful to scientists.  The code contains 
cardinality information that relates concepts with one another.  The layer also contains validation code 
that checks for data type errors, out-of-bounds values and illegal combinations of field values.  The 
<b>data storage layer</b> contains the code that is used to generate SQL queries, manage database resources, 
and do validation checks to check for non-existent or duplicate items in the database.
</p>

<p>
Interactions between layers should be strictly controlled so that they can maintain their separation 
of concerns.  Code in the presentation layer will typically extract field values from electronic forms to 
produce business objects. The business objects validate the form data as much as they can.  The objects 
are then used within the data storage layer to assemble SQL queries.  The queries are executed and the 
query results are assembled into business objects.  The objects are passed from the business concept 
layer to the presentation layer, where the results are rendered in electronic forms.  In this scenario, 
the business concept layer strictly mediates communication between the presentation and data storage 
layer.

<h2>Limit paths of execution through the code base</h2>
<p>
Design aspects of security, testability, reusability and concurrency all benefit when we take steps to 
strictly control paths of execution through the code base.  Limiting execution paths provides a way of 
focusing scarce developer resources on the most common code pathways while limiting the likelihood that 
problems associated with less common pathways will occur.  The approach is: if you can't fix a problem, 
at least hide it.
</p>

<blockquote>
<font color="green">
<i>
<b>
<a href="SummaryOfDesignDecisions.html#gen_design4">
General Design-4
</a>
</b>: 
Wherever possible, limit the paths of execution that are likely to occur.
</i>
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
One of the best ways of limiting execution paths is to properly encapsulate access to an object's data 
through accessor methods.  It is considered a good coding convention to declare class variables as private 
and make them accessible to client code through set and get methods.  Hiding the class variables from other 
classes provides two benefits:
<ol>
<li>
the way a variable is implemented or managed can be changed without having to change the client code
</li>
<li>
the accessor methods make it easy to use coding constructs that can allow an object's data to be accessed 
concurrently by pieces of client code that run within different threads of execution.
</li>
</ol>
</p>


<blockquote>
<font color="green">
<i>
<b>
<a href="SummaryOfDesignDecisions.html#gen_design5">
General Design-5
</a>
</b>: 
By default, give class variables and class methods the most restrictive visibility.
</i>
</font>
</blockquote>


<p>
Execution paths can be further constrained by limiting the visibility of classes with respect to one 
another.  The RIF code base has been organised into packages of classes that share a similar theme.  
For example, all the business classes used to support study submission and viewing study results appear 
in the rifServices.businessConceptLayer package.  Wherever possible, classes are given package-level 
visibility so that classes in other packages cannot use them.  For example, whereas 
<code>rifServices.dataStorageLayer.SQLInvestigationManager</code> has a need to see the class 
<code>rifServices.businessConceptLayer.Investigation</code>, there is no need for the <code>Investigation</code> 
class to see the <code>SQLInvestigationManager</code>.  The <code>SQLInvestigationManager</code> class is 
given package-level access so that only the other classes in rifServices.dataStorageLayer may see it.
</p>
  
<p>
Throughout the course of development, the visibility of some classes has had to be made public.  For 
example, <code>rifServices.dataStorageLayer.SQLConnectionManager</code> now has public-level access 
because code used in the services for the data loader tool need to use the same connection 
management facility.  
</p>

<blockquote>
<font color="green">
<i>
<b>
<a href="SummaryOfDesignDecisions.html#gen_design6">
General Design-6
</a>
</b>: 
By default, give classes package-level access.  Increase the visibility of a class only when there 
is a need to do so.
</i>
</font>
</blockquote>


<p>
So far, we have limited the execution paths in the code by restricting the visibility of an object's 
data and methods, and by limiting the access that one class has to use another class.  Our third way 
of limiting execution paths is to encapsulate the data storage and business concept layers of the 
architecture using service interfaces.  
</p>

<p>
The access of client applications to the code base is limited to a set of methods that are published 
as part of service APIs.  Although the service APIs have public-level access, the classes which implement 
them do not.  We do this to promote secure access, so that clients cannot access methods that are part of 
the class but which are not part of the service contract advertised in the interface.  
</p>



<blockquote>
<font color="green">
<i>
<b>
<a href="SummaryOfDesignDecisions.html#gen_design7">
General Design-7
</a>
</b>: 
Encapsulate business concept and data storage layers of the architecture through service APIs.  
Do not allow clients to know which class is implementing the service interfaces.
</i>
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
Another general design decision is embodied in the <a href="../CodingPhilosophy.html">Coding Philosophy</a>.  We
state it here because it helps lead into describing some of our general coding conventions:



<blockquote>
<font color="green">
<i>
<b>
<a href="SummaryOfDesignDecisions.html#gen_design8">
General Design-8
</a>
</b>: 
Apply the steps of the coding philosophy:
<ol>
<li>get it working</li>
<li>get it working for the next developer</li>
<li>get it working well</li>
</ol>
<p>
As well, favour coding to convention over coding to circumstance.
</i>
</font>
</blockquote>


<p>
Forcing client applications to interact with the code base via interfaces greatly limits sources of 
security and concurrency threats.  Assuming that the RIF database is installed on a secure Intranet, 
the main source of threats will come via calls to the service methods.  As well, a major source of 
concurrency threats will occur when clients have multiple threads accessing the objects they pass 
to the service calls.  Both of these issues, and the broader topics of <a href="./DesignForConcurrency.html">
concurrency</a> and <a href="./DesignForSecurity.html">security</a>, will 
be addressed in other sections of the design manual.
</p>

<h2>
General Coding Techniques
</h2>


<p>
Another way to minimise problems with security and concurrency is to make sure that all classes 
which are not abstract are marked final.  "Final" ensures that a class cannot be sub-classed.  
Preventing a class from being sub-classed eliminates the chance that a malicious class can override 
one of its superclass methods and produce a damaging side-effect.  It also ensures that a subclass 
will not have methods which introduce new concurrency problems that could occur in the superclass.  
In both cases, preventing a class from being sub-classed helps ensure that the code will have more 
predictable behaviour.
</p>

<p>
Developers are divided about whether this practice is beneficial in projects or not.  One opinion is 
that marking classes as "final" is a practice which is too restrictive and hinders other developers 
from adapting or reusing the code.   In my opinion, it is more important to assert that code suits its 
original purpose than to assert how it could be adapted for other uses.  Reuse presumes use, and use of 
software presumes that it behaves both correctly and predictably.  
</p>

<p>
Although we would like other developers to use our code, it is not a project priority and it should not 
outrank more important concerns related to security, concurrency and testability.   Our minimum unit of 
software reuse in the RIF project is not at the class level but at the service level.  Because we have 
made this decision, we do not feel compelled to make the code easy to adapt.  Instead, we take a very 
different approach: until we assert that a class should be extended, it should not be extended.  
</p>

<p>
Marking classes as final does not prevent developers from modifying the code to suit their interests.  
However, the effort they spend to make the changes should cause them to pause for thought and ask 
themselves if they are sure they know what the code will do.
</p>


<blockquote>
<font color="green">
<i>
<b>
<a href="SummaryOfDesignDecisions.html#gen_design9">
General Design-9
</a>
</b>: 
If a class is not abstract, it should be marked "final".
</i>
</font>
</blockquote>


<p>
By default, all parameters in all methods will be prefixed by the keyword "final".  When a piece of code calls
a method, it passes actual parameters which are assigned to formal parameters.  In the example below, the
variable <code>investigation</code> is declared and assigned the same reference as <code>myInvestigation</code>.  
Later on, <code>investigation</code> is reassigned the reference to 
Later on in the code, we are able to reassign <code>investigation</code> the reference for 
<code>anotherInvestigation</code>.  From this point onwards, any changes we attempt to make to the investigation's
fields will affect the ones in <code>anotherInvestigation</code>, not <code>investigation</code>
</p>

<code>
<pre>
Calling code:
{	
	Investigation myInvestigation = Investigation.newInstance();
	myInvestigation.setName("Investigation 1");
	...
	...
	x.doSomething(myInvestigation);
	
	//You'd think it prints "Investigation 2" 
	//but it actually prints "Investigation 1"
	System.out.println(investigation);	
}

public void processInvestigation(Investigation investigation) {
...

	//Should print "Investigation 1"
	System.out.println(investigation);

	//this is a bad idea but it will run without error
	Investigation anotherInvestigation = Investigation.newInstance();
	investigation = anotherInvestigation;
	
	//we are no longer altering a field value in the 
	//Investigation object that was passed to the method
	investigation.setName("Investigation 2");
...

...
}
</pre>
</code>

<p>
Few developers would intentionally try to reassign the value of a method parameter within
the method.  However, they could do it accidentally, thereby introducing errors which may be 
difficult to detect in some situations.
</p>

<p>
If lone developers are maintaining large amounts of code, they may want to leverage the
power of the compiler to identify mistakes they make.  If <code>investigation</code>
is declared as <code>final</code>, the compiler will complain that investigation is being
reassigned a value.
