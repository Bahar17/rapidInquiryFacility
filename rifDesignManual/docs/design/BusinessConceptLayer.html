<h1>RIF Architecture: Business Concept Layer</h1>

<p>
The main purpose of the business concept layer is to contain classes which describe concepts 
that are meaningful to scientists.  It is meant to be the first layer that new developers should 
study when they are learning the code base and is the first place where they should make changes 
when they are modifying properties of RIF concepts supported in the software.  Changes they make to 
classes in this layer will be partly or fully mirrored in the presentation layer, in the data storage 
layer, and in packages that relate to serialising or deserialising objects in various formats.
</p>

<p>
The business classes are designed to be neutral with respect to how the information they contain would 
be rendered in a display or stored in a database.  However, two concessions have been made:
<ul>
<li>
the support of a general "identifier" data field
</li>
<li>
the support of a display name for viewing in lists
</li>
<li>
by default, class fields should be of type String
</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
The first concession relates to how all of the business classes inherit a field called "identifier" from 
<code>rifServices.businessConceptLayer.AbstractRIFConcept</code>.  The identifier field is meant to 
correspond to an auto-generated primary key value that would identify a record in the database. 
</p>	
	
<blockquote>
<font color="green">
<i>
<b>
<a href="SummaryOfDesignDecisions.html#business_concept_layer1">
Business Concept Layer-1
</a>
</b>: 
Provide a generic identifier field within each business class definition. The identifier allows Java 
objects to be mapped to primary key values in corresponding database records.
</i>
</font>
</blockquote>
	
	

<p>
For example, in the database, each study is uniquely identified by a studyID field value that has no 
semantic aspect. It is useful for data retrieval purposes if a DiseaseMappingStudy object knows about its 
corresponding primary key value in the database.  
</p>

<p>
However, not all concepts in the database are identified by an auto-generated key.  For example, a 
geography object is uniquely identified by a name field which can be understood by an end-user.  
Therefore the 
<code>rifServices.businessConceptLayer.Geography</code> class will not be able to make use of the 
identifier field.  That some business classes use an auto-generated primary key while others use compound 
natural keys means that only some sub-classes will make use of the inherited identifier field.  This 
characteristic of the business classes shows one of the weaknesses of relying on an inheritance 
hierarchy: not all subclasses may have the same need for the same inherited properties.
</p>

<p>
The second concession of a neutral business class design involves providing a way for business objects 
to generate human-readable names that can allow end-users to distinguish between them in a list.  
Although a studyID might be able to distinguish one study from another, it will likely not hold much 
value for a human end-user.  It could be most useful to an end-user if the display name for a study 
included a combination of the date, the user who created it and part of a title.
</p>

Business Concept Layer-2
</a>
</b>: 
Support a business class method <code>getDisplayName()</code>, which returns <code>String</code> 
that allows end-users to distinguish an object in a list.
</i>
</font>
</blockquote>
	




<p>
The third concession involves making most class fields String values, so they may be compatible with 
the data type of text fields that would appear in electronic forms.  For example, consider the values 
for year range of an Investigation.  Start and end year fields should be integer values that represent 
reasonable values for a year.  
</p>

<p>
However, if the business class <code>rifServices.businessConceptLayer.YearRange</code> had a data 
type of Integer for these two fields, the class would have to rely on the client application to 
correctly convert field values into integers.  The client code would then have to include validation 
code to identify any problems that may occur with converting a text field value to an <code>Integer</code> value. 
</p>

<p>
By declaring its fields as String values, the business classes are better able to support more 
of the validation code that would otherwise be put in the client applications.

</font>
</blockquote>
	
<p>
An important aspect of designing business classes is considering how instances will be created 
or copied.  One common source of concurrency errors occurs when an object is somehow used before 
it has finished being created and initialised.  In one thread, the method for an object may be 
called, whereas in another thread that object has not finished setting initial values for its fields.  
One common technique for what is called "safe construction" is to discourage the use of public 
constructors in favour of factory methods.  For example, notice that 

<code>rifServices.businessConceptLayer.Investigation</code> has no public constructor methods, 
but it does have static factory methods newInstance(...) and createCopy(...) methods.  Within each 
of these methods, an instance of an Investigation is created and it only becomes visible to clients 
when that instance is returned by the static method.  Using these factory methods ensures that an 
object cannot be used before it has finished being instantiated.

	
<blockquote>
<font color="green">
<i>
<b>
<a href="SummaryOfDesignDecisions.html#concurrency1">
Concurrency-1
</a>
</b>: 
Make constructors private and rely on static factory methods <code>newInstance(...)</code> and 
<code>createCopy(...)</code> to control the creation of new objects.
</i>
</font>
</blockquote>


<p>
Another important aspect of business class design is how two instances might be compared.  
The idea of "a equals b" can have an ambiguous meaning in programming situations.  It can either mean:
<ul>
<li>
a and b 'point' to the same memory location
</li>
<li>
a and b have identical values for every corresponding pair of field values
</li>
</ul>

<p>
If two objects point to the same memory location, then they are guaranteed to have the same field values 
because they are the same object.  However, two different instances can point to different locations in 
memory but have identical field values.  In a third case, two different instances can point to different 
locations in memory and have different field values.
</p>

<p>
In Java, every class inherits the method <code>equals(Object object)</code> from Java's Object class.  This method is 
used in many operations that are implemented by Java's collection classes.  By default, this method returns 
true if two objects have the same hash code value.  However, if Java developers want the semantic that two 
objects describe the same content, they have to override both equals() and getHashCode().  As well, they 
would likely have to override the two methods in any subclasses they make.
</p>

<p>
Sometimes it is worth the effort to maintain the overridden methods.  For example, the <code>equals()</code> 
method of objects is used by the <code>contains()</code> method of various collection classes.  In 
scenarios where an application needs to frequently check whether an object with specific field values is 
already in a large collection, then it make sense to use this approach.
</p>

<p>
However, in the RIF, most of uses of the contains() method are checking whether a String is in the 
collection.  The equals() method of String is already implemented so that it checks if the contents of 
two strings is identical.  Therefore, we have little need to override the equals() method. Moreover, 
because many Java classes could make use of such a common and fundamentally important method, we would 
have to invest a lot of effort to ensure we had overridden the methods correctly.
</p>


	
<blockquote>
<font color="green">
<i>
<b>
<a href="SummaryOfDesignDecisions.html#maintenance5">
Maintenance-5
</a>
</b>: 
Do not try to override the behaviour of <code>equals()</code> and 
<code>getHashCode()</code>.  In the RIF code base, the effort needed to do this correctly outweighs 
the performance benefit we would gain from using Java's collection classes.
</i>
</font>
</blockquote>



<p>
We do have a need to compare two instances of the same class.  But we need it to return a set of 
descriptions of differences rather than a simple true or false result.   For example, it is more 
useful to know that Study A and Study B have different age groups rather than knowing that they do 
not have identical contents.
</p>


<p>
If each business class has a method ArrayList<String> getDifferences(...), it will make it easier for 
end-users to know how two slightly different studies might differ.  This feature will become more 
important as the scientists create more studies and run variants of them.
</p>


	
<blockquote>
<font color="green">
<i>
<b>
<a href="SummaryOfDesignDecisions.html#business_concept_layer4">
Business Concept Layer-4
</a>
</b>: 
Business classes should have a method <code>ArrayList<String> getDifferences()</code>, which 
describes the differences between two objects of the same class.
</i>
</font>
</blockquote>


<p>
The remaining two methods that most business classes should have are routines for identifying 
errors.  It is the role of each business class to recursively check whether any text field values 
contain malicious code.  For example, an Investigation may contain an SQL injection attack in its 
description field, or in the name field of one of its covariate objects.
	

	
<blockquote>
<font color="green">
<i>
<b>
<a href="SummaryOfDesignDecisions.html#security4">
Security-4
</a>
</b>: 
Business classes should have a method <code>checkSecurityViolations()</code>, which recursively 
check whether any String fields have any malicious code values.  Field values should be compared 
against a variable collection of regular expression patterns that are commonly associated with 
code attacks.
</i>
</font>
</blockquote>

	
	


<p>
The last major method that appears in business classes is one for checking errors.  Each 
business class has a method which recursively checks for two types of errors:
<ul>
<li>
field-level errors that are related to data type and range constraints
</li>
<li>
combinations of field values which together produce an error
</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
For example, in the class <code>rifServices.businessConceptLayer.YearRange</code>, <code>startYear</code> 
will have an error if its <code>String</code> value contains anything other than numbers. A 
<code>YearRange</code> having a startYear of 2000 and an endYear of 1998 will also produce an error 
because the startYear is greater than the endYear.   As another example, <code>Investigation</code>'s 
<code>checkErrors()</code> method will call the <code>checkErrors()</code> method of each of its 
<code>HealthCode</code> objects.
