<h1>Design for Security</h1>
The code base is designed to address three main security threats:
<ul>
<li>
malicious code attacks that can cause the database to harm or inappropriately disclose its data 
</li>
<li>
malicious code attacks that attempt to overload the database server with requests
</li>
<li>
exceptions that cause the RIF to disclose sensitive information
</li>
</ul>
